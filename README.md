# Challenge 1 Code Refractor

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

My motivation for doing this project was to try my hand at making a website more accessible. The code was given to me and I was asked to refract it, so that is what I did. I learned a lot doing this project espcially in HTML semantics, external CSS sheets and using an my browser to inspect and detect accessibility issues. 

This is what the website scored before I started:

And this is what it looks like now:
