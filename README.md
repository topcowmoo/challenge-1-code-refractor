# Challenge 1 Code Refractor

## Description

My motivation for doing this project was to try my hand at making a website more accessible. The code was given to me and I was asked to refract it, so that is what I did. I learned a lot doing this project espcially in HTML semantics, external CSS sheets and using an my browser to inspect and detect accessibility issues. 

This is what the website scored before I started:

And this is how it scored after I worked on it:
